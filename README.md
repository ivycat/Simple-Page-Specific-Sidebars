Add a sidebar to any specific page by creating a widget area on demand.

##Description##

Page Specific Sidebars adds a checkbox to every page allowing you to choose which pages should have a unique sidebar.  

Once you enable a page-specific sidebar in the page editor, a widget area will automatically be created for that page and you can customize it as you like.  

You can specify whether the plugin replaces your primary sidebar with the page-specific sidebar, or adds your page-specific sidebar to the existing sidebar.

For child pages, you can choose to inherit the parent's settings.  When a child page inherits its parent's settings, that child page will not have its own custom sidebar.  Default inheritance behavior can be set via the plugin settings page.


## Notes ##

Plugin has no built-in styling, and does not contain native styles; it is uses the styles from your existing theme.

This is a minimal plugin, placing function over form.  If you would like to extend it, or would like us to extend it in later versions, feel free to [contact us](http://www.ivycat.com/contact/), or post feedback in this plugin's [support forum]().

## Installation ##

You can install from within WordPress using the Plugin/Add New feature, or if you wish to manually install:

1. Download the plugin.
1. Upload the entire page-sidebars directory to your WordPress plugins folder.
1. Click Activate Plugin in your WordPress plugin page.
1. Visit the Settings / Page Sidebar Settings page to customize.

## Usage ##

Simply activate and go.  There are a couple filters for customization:

`$location = apply_filters( 'page_sidebar_location', 'side' );

$priority = apply_filters( 'page_sidebar_priority', 'high' );`

These allow you to change the location and priority of the metabox on the "Edit Page" view.

Contact us if you want some more filters or actions added.  http://www.ivycat.com/contact
